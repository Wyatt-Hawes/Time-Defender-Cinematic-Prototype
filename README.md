# **Cinematic Prototype**
-------------
- Non-Interactive cinematic: the logo when you first open the game is tweened (temporarily) and will have complex motion when we create a logo (Spacebar to reset the local storage to see logo again)

- Interactive cinematic: Title screen has interactable play buttons and a fully working options menu

- Choreography in code: Tween chains are used to control the title screen and the movement of the menu.
